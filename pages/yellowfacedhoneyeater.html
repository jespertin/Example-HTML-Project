        The yellow-faced honeyeater(Caligavis chrysops) is a small to medium-sized bird in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeyeater">honeyeater</a> family, Meliphagidae. It takes its common and
        scientific names from the
        distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins
        twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern
        Australia, in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas,
        and woodlands along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater,
        it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles,
        as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as Banksia and Grevillea,
        and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as gleaning them from the foliage
        of trees and shrubs.

        Some yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands migrate northwards
        between March and May to spend the winter in southern Queensland, and return in July and
        August to breed in southern New South Wales and Victoria. They form socially monogamous
        pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate cup-shaped nest. The success rate can be low,
        and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.

    <p style="margin-right:200px; margin-left:200px">
        Honeyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing,
        grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered
        by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be of least concern for
        conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.

    <p id="Taxonomy" style="margin-right:200px; margin-left:200px">The yellow-faced honeyeater was first described, and
        placed in the
        genus Sylvia,
        by ornithologist John Latham in his 1801 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici,
        sive Systematis Ornithologiae.[2][3] French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot
        described it as Melithreptus gilvicapillus in 1817, and English zoologist George
        Robert Gray as Ptilotis trivirgata in 1869.[4] The specific name chrysops is derived
        from the Ancient Greek words chrysos meaning 'gold' and prosopo meaning 'face', in
        reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.

        The yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011.[4]
        Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among
        honeyeaters in the genus, using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling, confirmed previous findings that
        Lichenostomus is not monophyletic.[6] Five species have previously been described as comprising the Caligavis
        subgroup, but studies, using the mitochondrial DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely
        related to the black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C. obscurus) of New
        Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus Caligavis. The generic name derives from the Latin caligo
        'mist, obscurity' and avis 'bird'.[7] The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus) and the Eungella honeyeater (B.
        hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus as Bolemoreus.[8] A 2017 genetic study,
        using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the
        common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around seven million years ago.[9]

    <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
        There are three subspecies of the yellow-faced honeyeater, two of which were described by Gregory Mathews in
        1912.[10][11] There are only very slight differences between the nominate race and C. c. samueli found in the
        Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia, and C. c. barroni from the Clarke Range and the Atherton Tableland in
        Queensland. The latter race is described as "poorly differentiated" and "possibly not worthy of recognition" by
        the Handbook of the Birds of the World.[12]

        The Surgeon-General of New South Wales John White caught a specimen in May 1788 calling it a yellow-faced
        flycatcher in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, which was published in 1790.[13] Latham called it the
        black-cheeked warbler.[2] John Gould called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848,[14] which has become its
        official name. It is also known as the yellow-gaped honeyeater, or the quitchup, in reference to its call.[15]
